# Magmos — Roadmap

**Magmos** = the Arc-native evolution of Sweem. We take Sweem's streaming-payroll protocol
(currently live on Sui) and rebuild it on **Arc** (Circle's stablecoin L1, EVM) for the
**Stablecoin Commerce Stack Challenge**, targeting:

> **Track 1 — Best Cross-Border Payments & Remittances Experience (UAE → Global)**
> 1st: 5,000 USDC · 2nd: 3,000 USDC

The premium Sweem UI is preserved verbatim. Only the chain layer (wallet, tx-building,
reads, addresses, auth) is rewired from Sui/Move → Arc/EVM.

---

## 1. Product framing (why this wins Track 1)

**Magmos — real-time cross-border payroll & remittances on HashKey Chain.**
UAE businesses stream USDC salaries, contractor payouts, and remittances to recipients
anywhere in the world — settled *per-second* on HashKey Chain with deterministic finality,
transparent dollar-denominated fees, and instant claim + cross-chain bridge-out via
Circle CCTP.

This maps directly onto the track's own examples:
- ✅ *"Global payroll / contractor payouts with stablecoin settlement and receipts"* — the core Magmos flow.
- ✅ *"Remittance app with transparent fees + real-time settlement confirmation"* — the per-second stream **is** the real-time settlement; fees are shown live and dollar-denominated.
- ✅ *"Marketplace settlement (UAE platform paying global sellers/creators)"* — same rails, different label.

**The wedge:** a freelancer in Manila / Lagos / Karachi opens Magmos and watches their pay
tick up per second from their UAE employer. They claim anytime and **bridge USDC to their
home chain via CCTP** (or route to a yield vault), with a receipt. Payroll that settles the
moment work happens — no 3-day SWIFT, no 6% remittance haircut.

**Circle stack used (all on HashKey Chain):**
| Tool | Use in Magmos |
|---|---|
| **USDC** | primary rail — pools, streams, claims, escrow |
| **CCTP v2 + Bridge** | recipient bridges claimed USDC to their home chain; org can fund cross-chain |
| **Circle Wallets** | embedded wallet UX for non-crypto-native recipients (stretch) |
| **Circle Gateway** | org treasury unified-balance / routing (stretch) |
| **USYC** | idle payroll float earns yield for the org (stretch, the "pays for itself" story) |
| **StableFX** | AED→USDC FX-aware settlement concept (stretch / narrative) |

---

## 2. What we keep vs. rewire

**Keep 1:1 (no visual changes):** all React components, Tailwind theme, framer-motion,
landing page, dashboard, onboarding wizard, employee/recipient portal, CSV+AI onboarding,
shadcn UI, brand assets.

**Rewire (Sui → Arc/EVM):** wallet provider, tx builders, on-chain reads, auth signature,
address validation, token/protocol config, backend RPC + sig-verify. (48 Sui-touching files
inventoried — see §6.)

**Drop:** Cetus DEX aggregator (`lib/cetus.ts`), Sui yield adapters (Navi / Scallop /
Suilend / stSUI / USDY). Yield, if built, is a single **USYC** adapter instead.

---

## 3. Target architecture

```
magmos/
├── contracts/        Foundry (Solidity) — HashKey testnet
│   ├── MagmosRegistry.sol     fees + treasury + protocol allowlist   (← registry.move)
│   ├── MagmosPayroll.sol      stream pools, deposit/claim/pause/stop  (← stream_pool.move)
│   ├── MagmosVault.sol        recipient multi-token vaults            (← employee_vault.move)
│   └── (stretch) USYCAdapter.sol   idle float → USYC yield
├── app/              Next.js 16 (ported from sweem/fe) — org + recipient portal
├── server/           Hono/Workers backend (ported from sweem/sweem-server)
└── packages/sdk/     (optional) embeddable pay/stream widget (← sweem-sdk)
```

**Chain layer stack:** `wagmi` + `viem` + connector (RainbowKit/injected), Arc chain config,
Multicall3 for batched reads, event-log indexing for stream discovery (mirrors Sweem's
chain-first read model). Backend: `viem` public client on HashKey Chain RPC; EIP-191/SIWE auth.

**Contract design notes (Move → Solidity):**
- **Time:** Sui `clock.timestamp_ms()` (ms) → EVM `block.timestamp` (seconds). Rate period
  becomes seconds. Per-second streaming is still "real-time" for payroll.
- **Pool model:** Sui `StreamPool<T>` shared object per (org, token) → single upgradeable
  `MagmosPayroll` contract with `mapping(bytes32 poolId => Pool)`, `poolId = keccak256(org, token)`.
  Gas-efficient, matches "one pool per token per org."
- **Custody:** Move `Balance<T>` held in object → ERC-20 balance held by the contract via
  `SafeERC20.transferFrom` (deposit) / `transfer` (claim). Track internal accounting to keep
  per-pool balances isolated.
- **Iteration:** Sui `Table<address, Stream>` → Solidity `mapping` (no native iteration) +
  events for the backend to index. Batched reads via Multicall3 (`claimable` per employee).
- **Streaming math:** identical — `earned = elapsed * rate / period`, `pending_balance`
  crystallization, `total_paused_ms`, min-claim floor, coverage floor. Ported with the same
  invariants and OpenZeppelin overflow-safe math (`Math.mulDiv`).
- **Roles:** `delegated_roles` bitmap → OZ `AccessControl` / simple bitmap mapping. Two-step
  org transfer preserved.
- **Fees:** deposit fee bps → treasury on deposit/topup (identical to registry.move).
- **USDC:** ERC-20 at `0x3600…0000`, **6 decimals** (confirmed on-chain). Native gas USDC is
  18-dec — deployer needs a little native USDC for gas.

## 4. Phased roadmap

> **Decisions locked (2026-07-01):** two apps (org + recipient) · CCTP-first, USYC yield as a
> stretch · wagmi + MetaMask now, Circle Wallets later · **backend = Next.js API routes +
> MongoDB** (chain-first core; not the Cloudflare/Postgres stack) · demo corridor = **mixed
> global** (a UAE marketplace settling with creators/sellers worldwide).

Explorer: https://testnet.arcscan.app/address/0xc810cabdCb4b22df29A54bdb0E124EE3ABA46093

### Phase 0 — Foundations ✅
- [x] Deployer wallet generated → `0xF1a800BA07Bd0b55Dce43be2e837933AF3e53226` (fund via faucet.circle.com)
- [x] Arc facts verified on-chain (chainId 5042002, USDC 6-dec, RPC live)
- [x] Foundry init + HashKey Chain network profile in `foundry.toml` (solc 0.8.28, evm cancun, OZ v5.6.1)
- [ ] `magmos/app` + `magmos/employee` scaffolds (Phase 2)
- [ ] Shared Arc config module (chain, RPC, addresses, ABIs) — emitted at deploy

### Phase 1 — Contracts (Solidity port) ✅ (deploy pending funding)
- [x] `MagmosRegistry.sol` — fees, treasury, protocol allowlist, AccessControl (2 roles)
- [x] `MagmosPayroll.sol` — createPool, createPoolAndDeposit, deposit, topup, claim,
      pause/resume/stop, `claimableAmount()` view, roles, enumerable discovery indexes
- [x] `MagmosVault.sol` — create vault, deposit/withdraw multi-token
- [x] Foundry tests — **36 passing** (stream accrual, pause math, min-claim, rate-change
      crystallization, fee split, access control, multi-recipient)
- [x] `forge script script/Deploy.s.sol` written + builds (emits `deployments/arc-testnet.json`)
- [x] **Deployed to HashKey testnet** ✅ (addresses above; verified live on-chain)
- [ ] Post-deploy admin setup (fees stay 0 for demo; approve USYC when adapter lands)

### Phase 2 — App chain layer (rewire, UI untouched)
- [x] Providers: `SuiClientProvider`/`WalletProvider` → `WagmiProvider` + injected connector + Arc chain
- [x] Wallet button rewired (`useAccount`/`useConnect`/`useDisconnect`, + wrong-chain switch), visuals kept
- [x] `lib/magmos.ts` (← `lib/sweem.ts`) — Arc addresses, ABIs, decimals, explorer URLs, poolIdFor
- [x] `lib/wagmi.ts` — arcTestnet chain + wagmi config; ABIs extracted to `lib/abi/*.json`
- [x] `lib/writes.ts` — viem/wagmi write-request builders (create/fund/claim/pause/stop/vault)
- [x] `lib/reads.ts` — viem read helpers (orgPools/getPool/employeesOf/getStream/claimable/USDC/vault)
- [x] deps swapped (@mysten/cetus → wagmi/viem/mongodb) and installed ✓
- [ ] rewire ~20 screen components to use writes/reads + wagmi hooks (the bulk of the work)
- [ ] `lib/tokens.ts` / `protocols.ts` → USDC / EURC / USYC on HashKey Chain; delete `cetus.ts`
- [ ] `lib/api.ts` → same-origin `/api/*` + EIP-191 auth (keep hook signatures)
- [ ] `isValidSuiAddress` → viem `isAddress` (onboarding CSV, wallet-button)
- [ ] full `next build` passes

### Phase 3 — Cross-border layer (Track 1 differentiator) 🎯
- [x] CCTP v2 on HashKey Chain: `approve` → `depositForBurn` (TokenMessengerV2 `0x8FE6…2DAA`, domain 26)
      → Iris sandbox attestation polling. Signature verified vs Circle docs + on-chain source.
- [x] Recipient "Send home" UI: destination-chain picker + multi-step burn/attest status + arcscan link
- [x] **Destination-chain `receiveMessage` mint — in-app**: wallet switches to Sepolia/Fuji/
      Arbitrum/Base, mints, destination explorer link, "Switch back to Arc" (full CCTP loop)
- [x] Circle Wallets passkey onboarding (`/passkey`) — register/login → smart account → gasless claim
- [ ] (stretch) Circle Gateway unified balance for org treasury

### Phase 4 — Backend = Next.js API routes + MongoDB (in `magmos/app/app/api/*`)
- [x] Mongo connection singleton (`lib/mongo.ts`) + `.env.local` (MONGODB_URI, gitignored)
- [ ] Collections/models: orgs, employees, groups, invoices, apiKeys (metadata only — no funds)
- [ ] API routes replacing the sweem-server surface the UI calls: `/api/orgs`, `/api/orgs/[wallet]/employees`,
      `/api/orgs/[wallet]/employees/bulk`, `/api/groups`, `/api/invoices`, `/api/ai/map-csv`, `/api/compute/*`
- [ ] EIP-191 auth middleware (viem `verifyMessage`) replacing Sui `verifyPersonalMessageSignature`
- [ ] `lib/api.ts` rewired to call same-origin `/api/*` (keep the `useSweemApi` hook signatures)
- [ ] CSV→columns AI mapping: keep heuristic-first; AI optional (defer Workers-AI)
- [ ] employee app calls the org app's `/api/*` (CORS) or shares via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`

### Phase 5 — Yield ("payroll that pays for itself") ✅
- [x] `MagmosYieldVault.sol` — ERC-4626 over USDC, 5% APY, live-growing share price (7 tests)
- [x] Deployed `0x3e711d38FFC65C278Fe78eC981bc5cEC5807D0c2`; deposit proven live on-chain
- [x] `/yield` treasury page — deposit idle USDC, live-ticking position, withdraw
- [x] Fire-theme reskin + magmos.png logo + Space Grotesk wordmark (both apps green)
- note: real USYC is KYC/teller-gated; this test-yield vault routes to USYC in production

### Phase 5b — Circle Wallets (passkey onboarding) — pending Circle credentials
- Modular Wallets support Arc + are viem-compatible (`@circle-fin/modular-wallets-core`)
- [ ] Blocked: needs a Circle Client Key + Client URL from console.circle.com to build/test

### Phase 6 — Polish & demo
- [x] Landing + dashboard + nav + FAQ copy → Magmos / Arc / remittance framing (visuals unchanged)
- [x] Faucet screen (`/faucet`) + faucet-mintable test USDC deployed on HashKey Chain
- [x] Demo script + pitch kit → `PITCH.md`; run guide → `RUN.md`
- [x] On-chain proof: streaming works with real USDC AND the faucet token (arcscan)
- [ ] Browser click-through of the full UI flow (proven via cast, not yet clicked)
- [ ] Walkthrough video + seed a scripted mixed-global demo org
- [ ] (stretch) rename `/public/sweem*.png` assets + `@sweem/sdk`/social handles to Magmos

## 6. Migration surface (48 Sui-touching files)

- **~26 tx builders** across `fe/lib/tx.ts` (1,421 loc), `employee/`, `client-test/`, `scripts/`
- **3 wallet providers** (fe / employee / sdk) — `SuiClientProvider` + `WalletProvider`
- **4 config files** with Sui package/object IDs (`*/lib/sweem.ts`, `scripts/config.ts`)
- **6 backend RPC ops** (SuiClient, getObject, getValidatorsApy, getTransactionBlock, verify)
- **2 signature-verify** impls (`sweem-server/src/lib/auth.ts`, SDK)
- **coin-type handling** in 5 files; **5 yield fetchers**; **Cetus** swap integration (drop)

Every one of these is enumerated with file paths in the migration notes and will be ported
or deleted phase-by-phase.

---

## 7. Open decisions (confirm before Phase 1 build-out)

1. **App structure** — one unified `magmos` app (org + recipient via route groups) vs. two
   apps (mirror Sweem's `fe` + `employee` split).
2. **Yield scope** — core remittance + CCTP first, USYC yield as stretch (recommended) vs.
   USYC in core scope vs. drop yield entirely.
3. **Recipient wallet UX** — wagmi + injected/MetaMask now, Circle Wallets embedded later
   (recommended) vs. Circle Wallets embedded from the start.
